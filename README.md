**Code**: 
1) Python 3.12
2) Editors: Jupyter notebook and Visual Studio Code.
3) Packages: Pandas

**Navigation**
1) Main code is in ETL_Mini_Project_Bhanot_Chuang.ipynb
2) The schemas is in Crowdfunding_ETL_DB_Schema.sql
3) The ERD is in ERD.pgn
4) Output folder contains CSV files of all transformed data.
